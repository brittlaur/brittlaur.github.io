      <h1>About The Project</h1>
      <p>This report analyzes the CDC's COVID-19 case surveillance database, which includes a large amount of data 
      collected during the pandemic. Our study aims to show how COVID-19 control measures, such as vaccination, affect public health outcomes.
      Even though we had some issues with missing data, we still think our results will be helpful. Our goal is to uncover correlations and 
      causal relationships between different factors and COVID-19-related outcomes by thoroughly examining all available data.</p>
