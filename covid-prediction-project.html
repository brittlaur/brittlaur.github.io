      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>This report analyzes the CDC's COVID-19 case surveillance database, which includes a large amount of data</p>
      <p>collected during the pandemic. Our study aims to show how COVID-19 control measures, such as vaccination, affect public health outcomes.</p>
      <p>Even though we had some issues with missing data, we still think our results will be helpful. Our goal is to uncover correlations and </p>
      <p>causal relationships between different factors and COVID-19-related outcomes by thoroughly examining all available data.</p>
