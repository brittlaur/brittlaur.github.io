      <h1>Housing & Inflation Predictive Analysis</h1>
      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>This report aims to analyze the effects of inflation on family income and house sale prices in the United States.</p>
      <p>The data used in this analysis is sourced from the FRED Economic Data Database provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
      <p>The dataset includes information on the median sales price of houses, mean family income, and the inflation rate for the United States.</p>
      <p>Our primary research questions are focused on understanding how inflation influences the affordability of housing for families. Our proposal is</p>
      <p>to merge the datasets and use linear regression to predict house sale prices using income and inflation. This report discusses the data sources,</p>
      <p>methods, potential challenges, and limitations of the analysis.</p>
